    <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">January 20, 2025</p>
        <p>Presented TSB No. 09-037/24 in person to Josh at Century Mazda. He initially dismissed the issue. Only after offering to pay out of pocket did he agree to order the part. This was the first documented request for action on the headlight safety issue.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">January 24 – February 10, 2025</p>
        <p>Vehicle left at Century Mazda. No updates were provided until we initiated follow-up. Ultimately told that the acceleration lag issue could not be replicated, and advised to try driving with a different technique. Headlight issue still unresolved.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">February 12, 2025</p>
        <p>Atlantic Field Technical Representative from Mazda Canada (Paul, not Paul Cotter) road tested the vehicle and installed software updates across several systems. Claimed vehicle was “operating as expected” post-update. Headlight issue again ignored.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">March 19, 2025</p>
        <p>Asked whether the headlight TSB part had been installed before picking up the vehicle. Was told it was only ordered March 6, despite our January 20 request. No explanation given. In July, Jenny from Mazda Canada stated the part was installed on this day—still unclear if this is accurate. Safety clearly not a priority.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">April 2025</p>
        <p>Century Mazda and CAG ceased communication entirely. No responses, no service contact, no updates. Jenny from Mazda Canada later stated that dealers are “independent” and Mazda cannot force them to deal with customers—despite safety concerns and brand obligations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">May–June 2025</p>
        <p>All outreach ignored by both Century Mazda and CAG. Vehicle remained parked. Safety concerns unresolved. No effort from Mazda Canada to intervene or support.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">July 16, 2025</p>
        <p>Called Mazda Canada and spent over 1 hour on the phone. Spoke with Jenny, who took over the case. I made it clear we would not restart with the dealer after 7 months. We requested a buyback. Jenny stated the dealership is independent and Mazda cannot force them to act. I objected, citing Mazda’s own compliance materials and brand obligations. Also made clear that a dealer ceasing communication with a customer over a safety issue is unacceptable. Pushed for escalation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <p class="date">July 30, 2025</p>
        <p>Called Mazda Canada and spoke with Claude, who informed me that Jason is now handling the case. I requested a call from Jason, but instead received an email later that day. Jason’s response gave three “options”: keep the car as-is, restart with the same dealer, or trade it in—passing the safety risk to an unsuspecting buyer. We again asked to escalate to Mazda Canada CEO Amy Fleming, outgoing CEO David Klan, and Global Compliance Officer Makota Yoshihara.</p>
