  <h2>The 7-Month Timeline</h2>

  <p><strong>December 2024</strong> – Reported persistent acceleration lag that created dangerous merging highway conditions, especially in colder weather. Was told we had to wait until January for an appointment.</p>

  <p><strong>January 20, 2025</strong> – Presented Mazda's official Technical Service Bulletin (TSB No. 09-037/24) to Josh, the service advisor at Century Mazda, for water intrusion into the front headlight assembly—a known safety defect. Century Mazda dismissed it, saying it “wasn’t raining enough.” <strong>Only after I offered to pay out of pocket did Josh agree to order the part.</strong> Also left the car for acceleration lag diagnosis. Despite asking for a road test, Mazda skipped it and assumed it was a software issue.</p>

  <p><strong>January 22, 2025</strong> – Notified Mazda via service text line that acceleration issue persisted. No reply until February 10.</p>

  <p><strong>January 24 – February 10, 2025</strong> – Noticed vehicle damage after pickup. Mazda first blamed a customer, then admitted their own lot attendant hit our car into a delivery vehicle. They told the other customer, but not us. After escalating to Century Auto Group (CAG) Owner Michael MacGillivray (michael@centuryauto.ca), I was told to speak with Jayson Pearce (Director). Mazda agreed to fix the damage. I reminded them the acceleration issue was still unresolved.</p>

  <p><strong>February 18, 2025</strong> – Car returned with claim that the issue was fixed by a Mazda Canada EV tech. But the problem persisted.</p>

  <p><strong>March 4, 2025</strong> – Reported continued issues. Service Manager Paul Cotter said Mazda Canada field managers were now involved and asked for car to be brought back in.</p>

  <p><strong>March 10–13, 2025</strong> – Requested pickup due to unsafe vehicle. Was told my wife must drop it off. Delays followed due to service manager absence.</p>

  <p><strong>March 18, 2025</strong> – Dropped off again. Paul (Atlantic Field Technical Rep for Mazda Canada, not Cotter) test drove it, applied EV-to-gas transition updates including to powertrain, transmission, and connectivity modules. Claimed it performed well.</p>

  <p><strong>March 19, 2025</strong> – Asked if TSB part had been installed. Told it was only ordered March 6—even though I flagged it on Jan 20 and offered to pay. <strong>In July, Jenny from Mazda Canada said it had been installed on this date. To this day, we have no confirmation.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>March 20, 2025</strong> – Asked if issue was reproduced pre-update. Mazda did not reply.</p>

  <p><strong>March 22, 2025</strong> – Issue returned. Mazda stopped replying via chat.</p>

  <p><strong>April 2, 2025</strong> – Sent firm follow-up via chat. Was told only one advisor had been working. Promised callback never came. All communications went silent.</p>

  <p><strong>April 2025</strong> – Century Mazda and CAG ceased all communication. Mazda Canada also stopped replying. <strong>Jenny from Mazda Canada later confirmed dealers “can choose who they want to deal with” and Mazda Canada cannot make them help a customer.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>May–June 2025</strong> – All communications ignored. Car parked indefinitely.</p>

  <p><strong>July 16, 2025</strong> – Called Mazda Canada. Spoke with Jenny for an hour. Two points:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dealer conduct:</strong> I said Mazda must enforce basic standards. Dealers should not be allowed to ghost safety-related issues. Jenny said Mazda Canada can’t force them to respond. I pushed back citing brand compliance obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Buyback request:</strong> I made it clear we will not restart with the dealer. We requested a Mazda Canada buyback. Jenny said that wasn’t an option and “this is the end of the line.” I pushed for escalation.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>July 30, 2025</strong> – Spoke with Claude at Mazda Canada. He said my file was now with Jason (not Jayson Pearce). I asked for a callback. Jason emailed instead. He gave 3 options: (1) keep the car, (2) return to Century Mazda and start over, or (3) trade it in to Mazda where it would be resold to an unsuspecting buyer—likely a family. <strong>This is Mazda Canada’s version of safety-first.</strong> I again requested escalation to Amy Fleming (incoming CEO), David Klan (outgoing CEO), and Makoto Yoshihara (Head of Compliance).</p>
