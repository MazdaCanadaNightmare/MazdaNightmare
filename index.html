    <h1>Mazda Canada Nightmare: Our Family‚Äôs 7-Month Ordeal</h1>
    <p>We paid full price in cash. Mazda delivered silence, damage, and risk.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>This site documents our family's ongoing 7+ month fight with Mazda Canada and Century Mazda (Halifax) after they sold us a defective CX-90 with a known safety issue, then ignored us, damaged the car on their lot, lied about it, and finally told us to ‚Äújust trade it in‚Äù ‚Äî so another family could inherit the risk.</p>

      <h2>Official Mazda TSB: Flickering Front Light When Raining</h2>

      <div class="caption">Mazda issued TSB No. 09-037/24 for the very defect we reported. They still failed to resolve it for months.</div>

    <h2>üö® Full Safety Timeline (Unedited)</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>Reported persistent acceleration lag that created dangerous merging highway conditions, especially in colder weather. Was told we had to wait until January for an appointment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 20, 2025</h3>
        <p>Presented Mazda's official Technical Service Bulletin (TSB No. 09-037/24) to Josh, the service advisor at Century Mazda, for water intrusion into the front headlight assembly‚Äîa known safety defect that compromises visibility. Despite the TSB, Mazda dismissed the issue, saying it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt raining enough.‚Äù Only after we offered to pay out of pocket did they agree to order it. We also left the car for diagnosis of the acceleration lag. Despite asking for a road test, Mazda assumed it was a software issue and skipped testing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 22, 2025</h3>
        <p>Notified Mazda via their service text line that the issue was still present. No reply until February 10.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 24 ‚Äì February 10, 2025</h3>
        <p>Noticed body damage on return. Mazda blamed another customer until we demanded video proof. Only after threat of legal action did they admit the damage was caused by their lot attendant. They told the other customer‚Äîbut not us. We escalated to Century Auto Group, but were stonewalled repeatedly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>February 18, 2025</h3>
        <p>Vehicle returned after body repair. Claimed acceleration was fixed by Mazda EV tech. It wasn‚Äôt.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 4, 2025</h3>
        <p>Reported continued issue. Mazda said they were now working with their ‚ÄúField District Technical and Service Managers.‚Äù</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 18, 2025</h3>
        <p>Paul, Mazda Canada‚Äôs Atlantic Field Technical Rep, road tested the vehicle and installed software updates related to EV-to-gas transitions. Claimed issue was resolved. It wasn‚Äôt.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 19, 2025</h3>
        <p>We asked if the TSB part had been installed. It had only been ordered March 6, even though the issue was flagged in January. Mazda Canada later claimed it was installed on this day, but no one can confirm. To this day, we do not know if it was ever fixed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 20‚Äì22, 2025</h3>
        <p>Picked up car, asked if issue was reproduced. Mazda refused to answer. The issue returned immediately. Mazda stopped replying via chat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April 2, 2025</h3>
        <p>Sent firm message after weeks of silence. Service promised a callback. No one followed up.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April ‚Äì June 2025</h3>
        <p>All communication from Century Mazda and Century Auto Group stopped. Mazda Canada also stopped replying. We parked the vehicle. Unsafe to drive. Unsafe to sell.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 16, 2025</h3>
        <p>Called Mazda Canada, assigned file owner Jenny. Told Mazda Canada has no power over dealers. We requested a corporate buyback. Jenny refused. Said this was "the end of the line." We pushed for escalation to leadership.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
        <p>We emailed Jason, Mazda Canada‚Äôs new contact, stating we would not trade in the vehicle and pass the issue to another family. We demanded our case be escalated to Amy Flemming (incoming CEO), David Klan (CEO), and Makota Yoshihara (Compliance/Risk, Japan).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 31, 2025</h3>
        <p>No reply from Jason. We called Mazda Canada and spoke to Haley, asking for confirmation that Jason received our message and passed it on. Nothing back that day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>August 1, 2025</h3>
        <p>Called Mazda Canada during business hours, got voicemail loop saying they were closed. Finally got through after 10 AM, spoke to Jenny. She confirmed Jason got the email and said he told her all three executives were sent our message. He planned to follow up later that day or Monday. No call ever came.</p>

    <h2>üìâ Corporate Ethics & Accountability</h2>
    <div class="image-section">
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MazdaCanadaNightmare/MazdaNightmare/main/mazda_tradein_email.png" alt="Mazda Canada Ethics Policy">
      <div class="caption">Mazda claims strong compliance and ethics values‚Äîbut their actual handling of this case says otherwise.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>üîÅ Trade It In and Let Another Family Suffer</h2>
    <div class="image-section">
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MazdaCanadaNightmare/MazdaNightmare/main/jason_tradein.png" alt="Jason's Trade-In Suggestion">
      <div class="caption">Mazda Canada‚Äôs ‚Äúsolution‚Äù after 7 months of risk, delay, and stress? Trade it in‚Äîand let another family inherit the problem. Tone deaf. Dangerous. Unethical.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è This Is About Family Safety</h2>
    <p>We paid cash, full price. We trusted Mazda. And we got silence, deflection, and lies. We wasted months. We escalated to every level possible. And now we‚Äôre being told to just‚Ä¶ trade it in? As if that erases the risk for the next family?</p>
    <p>Mazda‚Äôs handling of this issue is not just negligent‚Äîit‚Äôs institutional failure. It‚Äôs unethical. And it proves Mazda cannot be trusted to prioritize family safety.</p>

    <h2>üì¢ What You Can Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do not buy from Century Mazda in Halifax.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Do not trust Mazda Canada to protect your family.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Share this story.</strong> Let them know the public is watching‚Äîand families deserve better.</li>
    </ul>
