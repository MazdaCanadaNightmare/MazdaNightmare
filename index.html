    <h1>Mazda Canada Nightmare: Our Family’s 7-Month Ordeal</h1>
    <p>What Mazda and Century Mazda put us through for a safety issue they admitted—and then ignored.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We paid full price—cash—for a brand new CX-90. For over 7 months, we’ve been misled, dismissed, and left driving a vehicle with known safety issues. What started with a headlight TSB became a nightmare of delays, dishonesty, and finger-pointing by both Mazda Canada and Century Mazda in Halifax.</p>

    <div class="tsb-image">
      <h2>Official Mazda TSB: Flickering Front Light When Raining</h2>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MazdaCanadaNightmare/MazdaNightmare/main/tsb.png" alt="Mazda TSB">
      <p class="caption">Mazda issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB No. 09-037/24, dated August 1, 2024) for water intrusion into the front headlamp. The dealership initially dismissed it, saying it “wasn’t raining hard enough” to see the issue.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🚨 Detailed Safety Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>We report visibility problems due to headlamp flickering. The dealership dismisses the issue, claiming the rain “wasn’t heavy enough.” No inspection is done. We offer to pay out of pocket to install the TSB fix. They agree—but don’t follow through.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 2025</h3>
        <p>We return and show the TSB directly to Josh at Century Mazda. He agrees to order the part. Later, Mazda Canada tells us the part was “installed” before Mazda’s own records say it was ordered—clear miscommunication or false record-keeping.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 2025</h3>
        <p>We follow up and discover the part still wasn’t ordered. Only after persistent outreach does the dealership admit it and finally place the order—three months after they said they would.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April 2025</h3>
        <p>While the vehicle is in for service, it is hit by another car—on their lot. Initially, Century Mazda blames another customer. We later find out it was their own lot attendant, with a history of damaging vehicles. Only when we threatened legal action were we shown video footage confirming their lie.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>May 2025</h3>
        <p>We raise concerns about dangerous acceleration lag when merging. Mazda’s solution? “Floor it, let up, then floor it again.” This is not a real fix—it’s a liability, especially with children in the car.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>June 2025</h3>
        <p>Still no resolution. Multiple emails and service messages are ignored. No diagnostics booked. Mazda EV techs involved, but nothing changes. We are told a service manager will follow up. They never do.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
        <p>We formally request our case be escalated to Mazda Canada leadership: Amy Flemming (incoming CEO), David Klan (CEO), and Makota Yoshihara (Japan Compliance). Instead, we are told we can "trade in the vehicle" and let another family inherit the risk.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 31, 2025</h3>
        <p>We call Mazda Canada again. Haley confirms Jason received our email. We ask for confirmation that leadership saw it. No follow-up is provided. Our family continues driving an unsafe vehicle.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>August 1, 2025</h3>
        <p>We call again and speak with Jenny. She admits Jason saw the email but says he’s "waiting on more dealership notes" before responding. No response ever comes. No one calls us back.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="email-image">
      <h2>🚩 Mazda’s Response: “Feel Free to Trade It In”</h2>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MazdaCanadaNightmare/MazdaNightmare/main/mazda_tradein_email.png" alt="Jason Email Suggesting Trade-In">
      <p class="caption">After months of escalating this as a safety issue—Jason from Mazda Canada told us: <strong>"Otherwise, if you wish to trade in the vehicle at another Mazda dealership, you are more than free to do so."</strong><br/>Tone-deaf. After everything we shared, Mazda's advice is to dump the problem on another family. Unethical and shameful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ethics-image">
      <h2>📜 Mazda’s Own Ethics Policy</h2>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MazdaCanadaNightmare/MazdaNightmare/main/jason_tradein.png" alt="Mazda Ethics Policy">
      <p class="caption">Mazda’s own code of conduct says: <strong>“Treat customers fairly and do not give anybody an unjust benefit or take advantage of your business position.”</strong><br/>What part of this ordeal was fair? What part didn’t take advantage of a family stuck with a vehicle they can’t trust?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>⚠️ Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>We’ve wasted more than 7 months. We’ve sent over a dozen follow-ups. We’ve chased down managers, technicians, advisors, and corporate reps. Not once has anyone owned the issue. We work hard, we paid cash, and we’ve been treated like a problem—not a customer. Worse, they tried to pass this risk onto another unsuspecting family.</p>

    <h2>📢 To the Public:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do NOT trust Mazda Canada with your family’s safety.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Do NOT buy from Century Mazda in Halifax.</strong> They lied about vehicle damage, failed to order safety parts, ignored us, and blamed others.</li>
      <li><strong>Do NOT accept vague promises or email replies as “action.”</strong> Hold them accountable.</li>
    </ul>
