  <h1>Mazda Canada Nightmare</h1>
  <p><strong>7 Months. Zero Resolution. A Family Ignored.</strong></p>

  <h2>The Full Timeline of Mazda's Institutional Failure</h2>

  <h3>December 2024</h3>
  <p>We reported dangerous acceleration lag, especially in winter highway merging. We were told we had to wait until January.</p>

  <h3>January 20, 2025</h3>
  <p>
    We presented Mazda’s official <strong>Technical Service Bulletin No. 09-037/24</strong> to Josh at Century Mazda for a known safety issue: water intrusion into the headlight that reduced visibility in rain and fog.
    Mazda dismissed the issue, saying it “wasn’t raining enough.” Only when we offered to pay out of pocket did Josh agree to order the part.
    That same day we left the car for the unresolved acceleration issue. Mazda skipped a proper road test and wrongly assumed it was a software issue.
  </p>

  <h3>January 22, 2025</h3>
  <p>We followed up via Mazda’s service text line—no reply until February 10.</p>

  <h3>January 24 – February 10, 2025</h3>
  <p>
    We noticed body damage on our security camera when the car was returned. Mazda falsely claimed another customer caused it.
    Only after threatening legal action did they admit <strong>their lot attendant hit our vehicle into another</strong>.
    They told the other customer — but not us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were sent in circles between dealerships and finally escalated to <strong>Michael MacGillivray</strong>, Owner of Century Auto Group. After contacting him, <strong>Jayson Pearce</strong> admitted he received those emails and would now handle it.
  </p>

  <h3>February 18, 2025</h3>
  <p>The vehicle was returned with bodywork fixed. Mazda claimed the acceleration issue was resolved by a Mazda Canada EV tech. It wasn’t.</p>

  <h3>March 4, 2025</h3>
  <p>Service Manager <strong>Paul Cotter</strong> said they were working with Mazda Canada’s field team. We were asked to bring it back in.</p>

  <h3>March 18–19, 2025</h3>
  <p>
    We dropped the car off again. <strong>Paul (Atlantic Field Technical Representative)</strong> road tested and applied updates. When we asked about the TSB part, they admitted it had <em>only been ordered on March 6</em> — despite our request in January and offer to pay.
  </p>

  <h3>March 22, 2025</h3>
  <p>The issue reappeared. Mazda stopped replying to us via service chat. Silence again.</p>

  <h3>April 2, 2025</h3>
  <p>
    We sent a firm message. An advisor replied that only one staff was working. He promised a follow-up call that never came.
    No emails, no updates. <strong>They went silent. Again.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>April 2025</h3>
  <p>
    By now, all senior leadership at <strong>Century Mazda</strong> and <strong>Century Auto Group</strong> had gone dark.
    Mazda Canada’s representative <strong>Jenny</strong> would later confirm that <em>dealers can simply choose who they want to help</em> — and Mazda Canada couldn’t do anything about it.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    "They’re independent. We can’t force them to talk to you." – Jenny, Mazda Canada
  </blockquote>

  <h3>May – June 2025</h3>
  <p>
    We sent multiple emails and messages. <strong>No one responded.</strong> Not the dealership. Not CAG. Not Mazda Canada. 
    Our vehicle — with unresolved, verified safety defects — sat parked. Useless.
  </p>

  <h3>July 16, 2025</h3>
  <p>
    We called Mazda Canada and spoke with <strong>Jenny</strong> again. I made two things clear:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Dealers should not be allowed to cut off communication entirely</strong> from Mazda owners with open safety issues.</li>
    <li><strong>We were requesting a buyback from Mazda Canada itself</strong> — not the dealership.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Jenny claimed Mazda couldn’t do anything. I asked for escalation.</p>

  <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
  <p>
    We called again. <strong>Claude</strong> told us the case was reassigned to a new rep named <strong>Jason</strong>.
    I asked for a call — instead, we received an email.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mazda Canada’s official solution? Return to the same dealer that ghosted us for months… or <strong>trade in our defective, unsafe vehicle</strong> so they could <strong>resell it to another family.</strong>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Mazda's official response to a safety issue: "Trade it in and let someone else deal with it."
  </blockquote>

  <h2>What Mazda Put Our Family Through</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We were <strong>lied to</strong> about the source of vehicle damage.</li>
    <li>We were <strong>stonewalled</strong> by senior leadership at every level.</li>
    <li>We <strong>wasted over 7 months</strong> trying to resolve a documented safety defect.</li>
    <li>We <strong>provided the official Mazda TSB ourselves</strong> — only to be ignored.</li>
    <li>We were asked to <strong>put our children in a dangerous car</strong> or park it indefinitely.</li>
    <li>Mazda’s "fix" was to <strong>resell the unsafe car to another family</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>We’re a hardworking family. We don’t have time for this. We trusted Mazda. They failed us — and now they want someone else to unknowingly take on the risk.</strong></p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Mazda's own <strong>Corporate Governance and Ethics Code</strong> claims to put safety and customer care first.
    But when a real issue occurred — they disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have documentation, video footage, service transcripts, and every email. 
    We’ve played by every rule. Mazda didn’t.
