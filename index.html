    <h1>Mazda Canada Nightmare: Our Family‚Äôs 7-Month Ordeal</h1>
    <p>What Mazda and Century Mazda put us through for a safety issue they admitted‚Äîand then ignored.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We paid cash‚Äîfull price‚Äîfor a brand new CX-90. And for 7 months, we‚Äôve been ignored, misled, and put at risk by Mazda Canada and Century Mazda. What started as a known headlight issue (which Mazda itself documented in a TSB) became a case study in how not to treat customers, especially families relying on their vehicle for safety.</p>

      <h2>Official Mazda TSB: Flickering Front Light When Raining</h2>

    <h2>üö® Full Safety Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>We first report the headlight visibility issue. The service advisor tells us, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not raining hard enough to see the problem.‚Äù They perform no inspection and do not escalate the issue. We offer to pay out of pocket for the part listed in Mazda‚Äôs official TSB. They agree to order the part. It was not ordered.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 2025</h3>
        <p>We return to the dealership. This time, we show the TSB directly to Josh (service advisor). They again agree to order the part. Later, Mazda Canada claims‚Äîbased on ‚Äúnotes‚Äù‚Äîthat the part was already installed prior to the date the order was supposedly placed. The timeline doesn‚Äôt match across Mazda‚Äôs own internal records.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>February 2025</h3>
        <p>No follow-up from anyone at the dealership. We continue to drive a vehicle with a known water ingress and visibility issue. The vehicle becomes increasingly dangerous in rain and fog. Mazda Canada remains unresponsive to follow-up emails.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 2025</h3>
        <p>We follow up again and learn the part was never ordered. Only after requesting escalation do they place the order‚Äîmonths after the initial service request and our offer to pay. This is confirmed via internal notes shared later by Mazda Canada.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April 2025</h3>
        <p>While in service, our vehicle is damaged by a Century Mazda lot attendant who has a known history of vehicle damage. Century Mazda initially blames another customer. We are not notified. Only after threatening legal action are we shown the video footage, which contradicts their earlier claim. At that point, they admit their lot attendant caused the damage and had done so in the past.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>May‚ÄìJune 2025</h3>
        <p>Acceleration lag gets worse. Mazda EV techs acknowledge the issue but offer no fix. Instead, service advisors tell us to ‚Äúfloor it, let up an inch, and floor it again‚Äù to activate gas mode manually‚Äîa dangerous method in real-world traffic and merging situations, especially with children in the vehicle. Century Mazda ignores follow-up messages and never schedules diagnostics.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
        <p>We contact Mazda Canada directly. In response to our complaints about unresolved safety concerns, Jason from Mazda Canada emails back suggesting we ‚Äútrade in the vehicle at another Mazda dealership if we wish.‚Äù This would knowingly pass the problem to another family. We demand escalation to Amy Flemming (incoming CEO), David Klan (CEO), and Makota Yoshihara (Risk/Compliance, Japan).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 31, 2025</h3>
        <p>No reply. We call Mazda Canada again and speak with Haley, requesting confirmation that Jason received our reply and that the matter was escalated to Mazda leadership. We receive no follow-up email or call.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>August 1, 2025</h3>
        <p>We call again during regular business hours. Mazda‚Äôs system says they're closed. Eventually we reach Jenny, who confirms Jason received the message but is ‚Äúwaiting for additional dealership notes.‚Äù She says he may call that day or the following Monday. We‚Äôve heard nothing since. It has now been more than 7 months since we first reported the issue.</p>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>We‚Äôve wasted over 7 months. We‚Äôve chased people, sent emails, waited on empty promises. All while driving a vehicle that isn‚Äôt safe‚Äîand being told to trade it in and let another family take the risk. Mazda has failed us at every level‚Äîdealership, service, corporate, and executive.</p>
    <p>We work hard. We pay cash. And we expect our concerns‚Äîespecially safety issues‚Äîto be taken seriously. They haven‚Äôt been. Not by Mazda Canada. Not by Century Mazda. Not by the executives who allowed this delay to go unchecked.</p>

    <h2>üì¢ To the Public:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt trust Mazda with your family‚Äôs safety.</strong> If something goes wrong, you're on your own.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Century Mazda (Halifax).</strong> They hid damage, ignored safety issues, and delayed repairs for months.</li>
      <li><strong>This could be you.</strong> If Mazda won't stand by their product now, when will they?</li>
    </ul>
