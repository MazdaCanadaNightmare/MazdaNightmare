    <h1>Mazda Canada Nightmare: Our Family’s 7-Month Ordeal</h1>
    <p>What Mazda and Century Mazda put us through for a safety issue they admitted—and then ignored.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We paid cash—full price—for a brand new CX-90. And for 7 months, we’ve been ignored, misled, and put at risk by Mazda Canada and Century Mazda. What started as a known headlight issue (which Mazda itself documented in a TSB) became a case study in how not to treat customers, especially families relying on their vehicle for safety.</p>

    <div class="tsb-image">
      <h2>Official Mazda TSB: Flickering Front Light When Raining</h2>

    </div>

    <h2>🚨 Safety Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>We report a headlight visibility issue. We’re told by Century Mazda, “it’s not raining hard enough to see it.” No inspection is done. We offer to pay out of pocket for the part in Mazda’s TSB. They say they’ll order it. They don’t.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 2025</h3>
        <p>We return for service and show the TSB in person. Mazda agrees to order the part. Later, Mazda Canada says the dealership “claims” the part was installed on a date before it was even ordered. Complete timeline mismatch.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 2025</h3>
        <p>After multiple ignored service texts and messages, we follow up and discover the part was never ordered. They finally confirm it’s now been ordered—in March, months late.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April 2025</h3>
        <p>Mazda finally admits our vehicle was damaged on their lot—by their lot attendant—while in for service. Initially they blamed another customer. We were never notified. Only after threatening legal action were we shown the footage, which contradicted their original claim.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>May–June 2025</h3>
        <p>Acceleration lag gets worse. Mazda tells us to “floor it, let up, and floor it again” to make the car go. This is dangerous in real-world merging conditions—especially with kids in car seats. The issue is acknowledged by EV techs, but never resolved.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
        <p>We reply to Mazda Canada (Jason) stating that we will not trade in the vehicle and pass the problem to another family. That is unethical. We ask Mazda to escalate our case to Amy Flemming (incoming CEO), David Klan (CEO), and Makota Yoshihara (Risk/Compliance, Japan).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 31, 2025</h3>
        <p>No response from Jason. We call Mazda Canada and speak to Haley, asking for confirmation that Jason received our email and to ensure it was escalated to Mazda executives. No call or email is returned that day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>August 1, 2025</h3>
        <p>We call again during regular business hours, but Mazda's system claims they're closed. Eventually, we get through to Jenny, who confirms Jason received our email. She says Jason is waiting for more dealership notes and may call us later that day or Monday. No call comes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>⚠️ Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>We’ve wasted over 7 months. We’ve chased people, sent emails, waited on empty promises. All while driving a vehicle that isn’t safe—and being told to trade it in and let another family take the risk.</p>
    <p>We work hard. We pay cash. And we expect our concerns—especially safety issues—to be taken seriously. They haven’t been. Not by Mazda Canada. Not by Century Mazda. Not by the executives who signed off on this delay.</p>

    <h2>📢 To the Public:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don't trust Mazda with your family's safety.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Don’t trust Century Mazda in Halifax.</strong> They hid damage, ignored timelines, and gaslit us for months.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't let this happen to you.</strong> We’re speaking up so others don’t get trapped like we did.</li>
    </ul>
