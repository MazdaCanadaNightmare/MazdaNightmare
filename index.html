    <h2>💔 A Family Left Behind</h2>
    <p>This is our family car. My wife drives it with our two young kids. The acceleration lag has put us in terrifying situations — trying to merge with no power, no time, and no control. We’ve missed school events, work, and time with loved ones because this vehicle isn’t safe to drive. Mazda knows all of this. They’ve seen the videos. They’ve read the notes. But instead of helping, they’ve offered us one option: <strong>trade in the car</strong>. Let someone else take the risk. Let another family unknowingly buy a defective vehicle. Mazda would rather profit twice than take responsibility once.</p>

    <h2>📅 The 7-Month Timeline – Final Version (Plain Text)</h2>
    <pre class="timeline">
December 2024 – Reported persistent acceleration lag that created dangerous merging highway conditions, especially in colder weather. Was told we had to wait until January for an appointment.

January 20, 2025 – Presented Mazda's official Technical Service Bulletin (TSB No. 09-037/24) to Josh, the service advisor at Century Mazda, for water intrusion into the front headlight assembly—a known safety defect that compromises nighttime, fog, and morning visibility. Despite being shown the TSB, Century Mazda initially dismissed the issue, saying it “wasn’t raining enough” to replicate it. Only after I offered to pay for the part out of pocket did Josh agree to order it. At the same time, I left the vehicle for diagnosis of the acceleration lag issue. Despite specifically asking for a road test, Mazda assumed it was a software issue and skipped proper testing.

January 22, 2025 – Notified Mazda via their preferred service text line that the acceleration issue was still present. No reply was received until February 10th.

January 24 – February 10, 2025 – Called and asked to speak with the General Manager, Brenda West, after noticing body damage that was not present when we dropped the car off but was clearly visible on our home security footage when returned. Mazda initially claimed another customer caused the damage, but after we demanded video evidence and threatened legal action, they admitted their lot attendant caused the damage by hitting our vehicle into a stationary delivery vehicle. Mazda informed the other customer—but not us. Escalated the matter to Century Auto Group (CAG), which owns Century Mazda. The dealership attempted to stonewall any escalation contact, directing us in circles between Century Mazda and a Truro dealership.

We eventually acquired the name and email of the CAG Owner, Michael MacGillivray (michael@centuryauto.ca), and emailed him because Jayson Pearce was not returning messages. No one at the dealership or Truro Bible Hill location would provide Jayson’s direct contact information, despite confirming that he was the appropriate person to speak to. After contacting Michael, Jayson informed us he receives all of Michael’s emails and that it was fine to deal with him directly. We finally received a call back. At this time, we also reminded Mazda that the acceleration issue remained unresolved and would need to be addressed again.

February 18, 2025 – Vehicle returned after body repair, with claim that the acceleration issue had been addressed. We were told a Mazda Canada EV technician performed the work. However, the issue persisted.

March 4, 2025 – Reported that the issue was still occurring. Service manager Paul Cotter responded and said they were now working with Mazda Canada’s “Field District Technical and Service Managers.” We were asked to drive the vehicle back in for further inspection.

March 10–13, 2025 – Requested alternate transportation so my wife would not have to put our children in the unsafe vehicle. Was advised she would still need to drop it off. The service manager was reportedly out sick, causing delays in response.

March 18, 2025 – Vehicle dropped off again. Paul, the Atlantic Field Technical Representative for Mazda Canada (not Paul Cotter), road tested the vehicle, then installed updates to the EV to gas mode transition system. Updates reportedly included the powertrain, transmission, vehicle control modules, tuner amps, and connectivity modules. Paul claimed to be satisfied with post-update performance.

March 19, 2025 – Before picking up the vehicle, asked whether the TSB part for the flickering headlight had been installed. Was told the part had only been ordered on March 6, despite originally flagging it on January 20 and offering to pay for it. No explanation was provided for the delay. Later in July, Jenny from Mazda Canada claimed the part had been installed on this date, but we have no confirmation or clarity. To this day, we do not know whether the TSB fix was applied. Mazda claims to prioritize safety—yet we have received no clear or trustworthy answer.

March 20, 2025 – Picked up the car and asked if Mazda’s field agents had been able to reproduce the issue prior to applying the update. Mazda chose not to reply.

March 22, 2025 – Issue presented again. Mazda stopped replying to service chat.

April 2, 2025 – Sent a firm message through the chat line after multiple weeks of no reply. Was told only one service advisor had been working. He promised to follow up with the service manager and schedule another diagnostic. That call never came. No emails or calls were returned. Mazda had gone silent again.

April 2025 – Century Mazda and CAG had now fully ceased communication. No service contact. No follow-up. No response from Mazda Canada either. At this point, the most senior representatives at the dealership and parent group were aware of the ongoing safety issue, yet opted for silence. Jenny from Mazda Canada later confirmed in July that dealers can “choose who they want to deal with” and that Mazda Canada cannot force them to help a customer. Is this what Mazda calls a customer-first approach?

May–June 2025 – Any and all outbound communication from me was ignored by CAG and Century Mazda. Car remained parked.

July 16, 2025 – I contacted Mazda Canada directly and spent an hour on the phone detailing the entire situation. I was connected to Jenny, who became my file owner.

First, I made clear that Mazda Canada has a responsibility to enforce a minimum standard of conduct with its dealer network, especially when it comes to unresolved and acknowledged safety issues. At the very least, Century Mazda should not be allowed to cut off communication entirely with a Mazda owner whose vehicle has a known safety concern. Jenny stated that Mazda Canada could not force the dealer to act, since they are “independent.” I told her that was unacceptable and contradicted Mazda's own compliance policy and brand control obligations.

Second, I informed Jenny that we were not willing to start over at the dealership after 7 months of unresolved issues. We requested a buyback directly from Mazda Canada. That buyback request was not a dealer issue—it was a request for corporate resolution. Jenny said there was nothing she could do and that this was the end of the line. I pushed for escalation.

July 30, 2025 – Called Mazda Canada and spoke with Claude, who advised me that my file had been escalated and was now assigned to a new representative, Jason (not Jayson Pearce from CAG). I asked Claude to have Jason call me. Instead, I received an email from Jason later that day.

I replied to Jason, advising him that we, unlike Mazda, are actually concerned about the car’s safety and would not be trading it in and passing the problem to another family. Mazda expects us to take a loss on a vehicle that is not safe to drive through a trade-in, allowing another Mazda dealer to resell it and pass the problem to an unsuspecting family. I also advised that we are not going to restart the 7-month process. I asked that my case and email be escalated to Amy Flemming (incoming CEO), David Klan (outgoing CEO), and Makota Yoshihara (Corporate Risk & Compliance – Japan).

July 31, 2025 – I hadn't heard back from Jason, so I called Mazda Canada again and spoke with Haley. I explained that Jason hadn’t acknowledged my response and hadn’t spoken with me directly before making his recommendation. I again requested that the email be escalated to Amy, David, and Makota. I received no call or email follow-up from Jason.

August 1, 2025 – I called Mazda Canada again during regular hours but was told via auto-response that they were closed. After trying again multiple times, I was finally able to reach someone just after 10 a.m. I spoke with Jenny again, who said Mazda doesn’t take calls until after 10 a.m. on Fridays due to meetings. I suggested they update their phone message to reflect that. I asked to speak to Jason, but she said he typically does not take calls. After a brief hold, Jenny confirmed Jason received my email and told her to let me know that it had been shared with Amy, David, and Makota. Jason was still waiting on “technical notes” from the dealer and said he hoped to have them by the end of the day. If not, he would attempt to call me later that day or Monday next week. After no call later in the day, I called Mazda Canada reached Annie who said I was being unreasonable and Mazda insists I start diagnosis over again, or trade my car, even with the safety issue.
