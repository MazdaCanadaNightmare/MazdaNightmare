      <h2>Full Timeline</h2>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">Dec 2024</div>
        We first raised the acceleration lag issue with Century Mazda.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">Jan 2025</div>
        We had our first service appointment to address the issue. I also showed the TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) to Josh in person on Jan 20.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">Late Jan 2025</div>
        Dealership admitted that the lot attendant damaged our vehicle after I viewed the video. Brenda confirmed this via text. The other customer involved was told — we were not.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">Feb 2025</div>
        Despite agreement to order the TSB part (headlight protector), nothing was ordered. I had to follow up repeatedly.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">Mar 19, 2025</div>
        I sent another follow-up about the unresolved safety issue. No reply.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">Apr 1, 2025</div>
        I received a generic survey message asking not to report dissatisfaction to Mazda Canada.

      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">Apr 2, 2025</div>
        I asked why I was being ignored. They said they only had one advisor for two weeks and would escalate to Paul.

      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <div class="timeline-date">June 26, 2025</div>
        I emailed Jayson Pearce, Director of Century Auto Group, asking for a meeting. No response.

      <h2>Caught on Camera — and Still Tried to Hide It</h2>
      <img src="caught_on_camera_confession.png" alt="Brenda text message confirmation" />
      <p>
        Century Mazda only admitted fault after I personally viewed the security footage showing their lot attendant clearly hitting my vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more disturbing — the owner of the other car involved was informed… But I wasn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        They claimed the lot attendant didn’t know — but anyone who’s seen the video knows that’s not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was sent home with visible damage they already knew about. The only reason I can speculate? They were hoping I wouldn’t notice right away — and if I did, it would be too late to prove it was them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security Footage Still</h2>
      <img src="security_footage_still.png" alt="Security video still" />
      <p>
        Originally, I was told I couldn’t see the video because a customer caused the damage and privacy laws applied. But the video clearly shows the lot attendant — and it turns out this wasn’t their first incident. They tried to hide this because the attendant had already damaged several cars.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Mazda’s Fix: Floor It and Pray?</h2>
      <img src="mazda_kickdown_note.png" alt="Mazda kickdown switch note" />
      <img src="mazda_kickdown_email.png" alt="Mazda service advisor email" />
      <p>
        Mazda’s own documentation explains that you need to slam the pedal to engage gas mode, which is supposed to help the car move faster in emergencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality? It works ~20% of the time. I was told to try it multiple times — mid-merge — with my family in the car.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Corporate Ethics? Or Just PR?</h2>
      <img src="mazda_tradein_email.png" alt="Mazda Canada email about ethics" />
      <img src="ethics_code.png" alt="Mazda ethics code" />
      <p>
        Mazda’s Corporate Ethics Code says they value safety, honesty, and transparency. But Mazda Canada’s response has been the exact opposite. Century Mazda failed across the board — and Mazda Canada continues to defend them by hiding behind “independence” while letting this happen under their brand.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Trade It In and Let Another Family Suffer</h2>
      <img src="jason_tradein.png" alt="Mazda Canada suggesting trade-in" />
      <p>
        Instead of resolving the safety defect, Mazda suggested I trade in the car. That’s right — pass the issue on to another family. Absolutely reckless.
