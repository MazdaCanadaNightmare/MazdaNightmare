    <h1>🚨 Mazda Canada: Safety Ignored, Families at Risk</h1>
    <p>Our 7-month journey through delays, deception, and danger — now fully public.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We paid cash for a 2024 Mazda CX-90 expecting safety, support, and transparency. What we received was none of that. Mazda Canada and Century Mazda ignored a serious vehicle issue for **over 7 months**, lied about damage, misled us about repairs, and ultimately told us we were "unreasonable." Their solution? Trade in the unsafe vehicle and let **another family** inherit the risk. That was the final straw.</p>

      <h2>Official Mazda TSB — Flickering Headlight (Aug 2024)</h2>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MazdaCanadaNightmare/MazdaNightmare/main/tsb.png" alt="Mazda TSB">
      <p>This TSB proves Mazda knew about the defect — yet delayed fixing it for months.</p>

    <h2>📅 The Full Timeline: Mazda’s Institutional Negligence</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <!-- Detailed, approved timeline injected here -->
      <!-- For brevity in this sample, we'll assume this block contains the fully approved, detailed version -->
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>Reported persistent acceleration lag in cold weather. Appointment pushed to January. Safety issue ignored.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 20, 2025</h3>
        <p>Presented Mazda’s official TSB (No. 09-037/24) in person. Mazda dismissed it until we offered to pay out-of-pocket. Left vehicle for acceleration issue testing — they skipped it, assumed software bug.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 24 – February 10, 2025</h3>
        <p>Vehicle returned damaged. Mazda blamed another customer until we demanded footage. Then admitted their own lot attendant caused it. We were never notified — the other customer was.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 2025</h3>
        <p>Finally told the TSB part had been ordered (despite offering in January). Delay still unexplained. EV software patched, but issue persisted. Mazda became silent.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April–June 2025</h3>
        <p>All communication stopped. No follow-ups, no diagnostics, no support. Mazda confirmed dealers can “choose who they deal with.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 30 – August 1, 2025</h3>
        <p>Jason from Mazda Canada suggests we either restart the entire 7-month process or trade in the vehicle — knowingly allowing the next buyer (another family) to inherit the safety risk. We called this out as unacceptable. Mazda's final answer? “That's your only option.”</p>

      <h2>Corporate Ethics? Or Brand Hypocrisy?</h2>

      <p>Jason from Mazda Canada — suggesting a **trade-in** for a known safety issue. Is this ethical?</p>

      <h2>Trade It In — and Let Another Family Suffer?</h2>

      <p>“If you believe there is an issue…” — we’ve lived it for 7 months. Mazda’s response: pass it on.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>⚠️ We Are Speaking Out Because:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We’ve been ignored for over **200 days**.</li>
      <li>We were lied to about the damage to our vehicle.</li>
      <li>We were told to use **unsafe workarounds** with children in the car.</li>
      <li>Mazda Canada denied any responsibility and called us **unreasonable**.</li>
      <li>They suggested **trading in** the vehicle — passing the safety issue to another unsuspecting family.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚫 Don’t Let This Happen To You</h2>
    <p>Mazda Canada and Century Mazda in Halifax failed us — and **will fail others** if held unaccountable. No family should be treated this way. We are releasing every detail publicly until real accountability is served.</p>
