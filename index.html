    <h1>Mazda Canada Nightmare: Our Family‚Äôs 7-Month Ordeal</h1>
    <p>What Mazda and Century Mazda put us through for a safety issue they admitted‚Äîand then ignored.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We paid full price‚Äî**in cash**‚Äîfor a brand new CX-90. Since then, we‚Äôve been repeatedly ignored, misled, and left driving a vehicle that puts our family at risk. What started as a known safety issue‚Äî**outlined in Mazda‚Äôs own internal TSB**‚Äîspiraled into a 7+ month ordeal of dealership denials, false claims, and corporate indifference.</p>

    <h2>üö® Full Safety Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>Reported persistent acceleration lag that created dangerous merging highway conditions, especially in colder weather. Was told we had to wait until January for an appointment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 20, 2025</h3>
        <p>Presented Mazda's TSB No. 09-037/24 for water intrusion into the headlight‚Äîcompromising fog and night visibility. Despite seeing the TSB, Century Mazda said ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt raining enough‚Äù to replicate it. Only after we offered to pay out of pocket did Josh agree to order the part. We also reported the acceleration lag and requested a proper road test, which Mazda skipped.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 22, 2025</h3>
        <p>Messaged Mazda via their text line stating the acceleration issue was still present. No response until February 10.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 24 ‚Äì February 10, 2025</h3>
        <p>Noticed new body damage. Mazda first blamed another customer, but after we demanded video footage and threatened legal action, they admitted their lot attendant hit our vehicle into a delivery car. They told the other customer, but not us. Escalated to Century Auto Group (CAG). Got the runaround until we finally reached Michael MacGillivray (owner), then Jayson Pearce (Director of Operations), who confirmed he gets Michael‚Äôs emails. Only then did we get a call back.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>February 18, 2025</h3>
        <p>Car returned after body repairs. Mazda claimed an EV tech had addressed the acceleration issue. It wasn‚Äôt resolved.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 4, 2025</h3>
        <p>Reported the issue again. Paul Cotter said Mazda Canada‚Äôs Field Technical and Service Managers were now involved. Asked us to bring the car in again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 10‚Äì13, 2025</h3>
        <p>Requested alternate transportation due to safety concerns. Was told my wife still had to drop off the car. Delays due to service manager being out sick.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 18, 2025</h3>
        <p>Paul (Mazda Canada rep) road tested and installed updates to transition systems. Claimed he was satisfied with the result.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 19, 2025</h3>
        <p>Asked whether TSB part was installed. Told it had only been ordered March 6. Mazda later claimed the part was installed on March 19‚Äîbut we never received confirmation. We still don‚Äôt know if it was.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 20, 2025</h3>
        <p>Picked up the car. Mazda declined to confirm whether they reproduced the issue before applying updates.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 22, 2025</h3>
        <p>Issue occurred again. Mazda stopped replying to service chat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April 2, 2025</h3>
        <p>Sent firm message after weeks of silence. Advisor said he‚Äôd speak with manager and schedule diagnostic. No call came. No reply since.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April ‚Äì June 2025</h3>
        <p>All communication ceased. Mazda Canada rep Jenny later said dealers ‚Äúcan choose who they want to deal with.‚Äù Car was parked due to safety concerns.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 16, 2025</h3>
        <p>Called Mazda Canada, connected to Jenny. We asked Mazda to enforce conduct standards for its dealers. Jenny said Mazda Canada can‚Äôt force dealers to act. We requested a buyback‚ÄîMazda Canada declined. Asked for escalation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
        <p>Called Mazda Canada and spoke to Claude. He said our file was reassigned to Jason. Asked for a call. Received email instead. Jason advised we either (1) keep it, (2) go back to the dealer, or (3) trade it in and let another Mazda dealer resell it to a new family.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>Later that day</h3>
        <p>We replied to Jason. Told him trading in the vehicle and passing the issue to another family was unethical. We demanded escalation to Amy Flemming (incoming CEO), David Klan (CEO), and Makoto Yoshihara (Compliance, Japan).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 31, 2025</h3>
        <p>Called Mazda Canada again. Spoke with Haley. Explained Jason never responded to our email and never spoke to us before suggesting his resolution. Reiterated our request for executive escalation. No reply from Jason that day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>August 1, 2025</h3>
        <p>Attempted to call during business hours‚Äîsystem said they were closed. Finally got through after 10am. Jenny answered, said Friday calls start late due to meetings. She confirmed Jason received our email and said he would try to call us later that day or Monday. No call has come.</p>

      <div class="caption">Jason from Mazda Canada: ‚ÄúIf you believe there‚Äôs an issue, trade it in.‚Äù<br>This, after 7 months of delays, escalation, and documented danger. Tone-deaf doesn‚Äôt begin to describe it.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è This is Bigger Than One Car</h2>
    <p>This is about <strong>corporate responsibility</strong>. It‚Äôs about families being misled, lied to, and ignored. It‚Äôs about dealers passing the buck and Mazda Canada enabling it. We‚Äôve spent 7 months chasing answers‚Äîwhile our vehicle sits unused because it‚Äôs not safe.</p>

    <h2>üì¢ We‚Äôre Going Public So You Don‚Äôt Have To</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt trust Mazda Canada with your family‚Äôs safety.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt trust Century Mazda in Halifax.</strong> They hid vehicle damage, ignored a TSB, and never followed up.</li>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt believe the PR. Believe our timeline.</strong></li>
