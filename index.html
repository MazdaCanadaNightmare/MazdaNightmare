    <h1>Mazda Canada Nightmare: Our Family‚Äôs 7-Month Ordeal</h1>
    <p>What Mazda and Century Mazda put us through for a safety issue they admitted‚Äîand then ignored.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We paid cash‚Äîfull price‚Äîfor a brand new CX-90. And for 7 months, we‚Äôve been ignored, misled, and put at risk by Mazda Canada and Century Mazda. What started as a known headlight issue (which Mazda itself documented in a TSB) became a case study in how not to treat customers, especially families relying on their vehicle for safety.</p>

    <h2>üö® Full Safety Timeline</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>Reported headlight visibility issue. Century Mazda claimed ‚Äúit‚Äôs not raining hard enough‚Äù to see it and did not inspect the car. We showed them the official TSB and offered to pay out of pocket to have the part installed. They agreed to order it, but it was never ordered.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>January 20, 2025</h3>
        <p>Returned to the dealership and showed the TSB in person to Josh (service advisor). Mazda agreed to order the part again. Despite this, Mazda Canada's records later showed the part was installed on a date *before* the part was even ordered‚Äîan internal contradiction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>March 19, 2025</h3>
        <p>Followed up due to no contact. A service text went unanswered. Josh eventually replied stating he was the only advisor and would escalate the issue to the service manager. No follow-up call or appointment was ever booked.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April 2, 2025</h3>
        <p>Received an apology from Mazda Halifax acknowledging acceleration lag and promising a diagnostic appointment. That follow-up never came. We continued to drive an unsafe vehicle with unresolved lag while merging onto highways with children in the car.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>April 2025 (Multiple Dates)</h3>
        <p>Finally shown video footage that confirmed Mazda‚Äôs lot attendant damaged our vehicle. Century Mazda had previously claimed a customer was responsible. We were never notified until we pushed to see the footage. They cited the attendant's disability as an excuse for the incident and delay.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>May‚ÄìJune 2025</h3>
        <p>Acceleration lag worsened. Mazda staff recommended we ‚Äúfloor it, then let up, then floor it again‚Äù to get the vehicle to switch modes‚Äîan extremely dangerous action when merging on short cloverleaf ramps with children in the car.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
        <p>We email Mazda Canada asking to escalate the matter due to the unresolved issues and delays. We reference the TSB again and demand action. We ask for escalation to Amy Flemming, David Klan, and Makota Yoshihara. No meaningful response is given.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>July 31, 2025</h3>
        <p>No reply from Jason at Mazda Canada. We call and speak to Haley and ask for confirmation that the email was received and escalation was made. No follow-up occurs despite her promise to get back to us.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-entry">
        <h3>August 1, 2025</h3>
        <p>We call again. Mazda‚Äôs phone system says they are closed during regular hours. We eventually reach Jenny, who confirms Jason received our email and may respond by Monday. Still no call comes. She also confirms Mazda‚Äôs internal records show the TSB part was installed *before* the dealership says it was even ordered. When asked about this contradiction, she has no explanation.</p>

    <h2>Corporate Ethics? Or a PR Shell?</h2>

      <div class="image-caption">Mazda claims their dealers are independent‚Äîyet proudly publish governance policies that say otherwise.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Trade It In and Let Another Family Suffer?</h2>
    <div class="image-section">
      <img src="mazda_tradein_email.png" alt="Mazda Jason Email">
      <div class="image-caption">Jason from Mazda Canada: ‚ÄúIf you believe there‚Äôs an issue, trade it in.‚Äù<br>This, after 7 months of delays, escalation, and documented danger. Tone-deaf doesn‚Äôt begin to describe it.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>We‚Äôve wasted over 7 months. We‚Äôve chased people, sent emails, waited on empty promises. All while driving a vehicle that isn‚Äôt safe‚Äîand being told to trade it in and let another family take the risk.</p>
    <p>We work hard. We pay cash. And we expect our concerns‚Äîespecially safety issues‚Äîto be taken seriously. They haven‚Äôt been. Not by Mazda Canada. Not by Century Mazda. Not by the executives who signed off on this delay.</p>

    <h2>üì¢ To the Public:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt trust Mazda with your family‚Äôs safety.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt trust Century Mazda in Halifax.</strong> They hid damage, ignored timelines, and gaslit us for months.</li>
      <li><strong>Don‚Äôt let this happen to you.</strong> We‚Äôre speaking up so others don‚Äôt get trapped like we did.</li>
    </ul>
