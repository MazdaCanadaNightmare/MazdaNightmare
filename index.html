      <h2>Timeline of Neglect & Broken Promises</h2>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>December 2024</h3>
        <p>Reported dangerous acceleration lag—was told to wait a month for an appointment, despite safety risk in winter driving.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>January 20, 2025</h3>
        <p>Presented Mazda’s official safety bulletin (TSB 09-037/24) for a headlight defect. Dismissed by dealership, only acknowledged when I offered to pay. Vehicle left for acceleration diagnosis—Mazda skipped the road test entirely.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>January 22–Feb 10</h3>
        <p>Acceleration still unresolved. Mazda ignored messages for weeks. Body damage discovered after pickup. Mazda lied, blaming a customer—only admitted fault after threat of legal action and security footage proof. Still didn’t notify us directly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>February 18, 2025</h3>
        <p>Vehicle returned after repairs—acceleration issue still not fixed despite Mazda Canada tech “working” on it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>March 4–19, 2025</h3>
        <p>Was told updates were applied to multiple systems. Asked if the safety fix for headlights was installed—wasn’t. Despite requesting it months earlier and offering to pay. To this day, we don’t know if it was ever done.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>March 22 – April</h3>
        <p>Issue came back. Mazda stopped replying. After being told they'd follow up, they vanished—again. No service contact. No dealer response. Mazda Canada silent.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>May–June 2025</h3>
        <p>Every attempt at contact ignored. No help. No support. We parked the car. A family vehicle, unsafe to drive.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>July 16, 2025</h3>
        <p>Spoke with Mazda Canada rep Jenny. Was told dealers “choose who they serve.” Refused to accept responsibility. Buyback request denied. Told it’s up to the dealer—who ghosted us months ago.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="event">
        <h3>July 30, 2025</h3>
        <p>Escalated again. New rep Jason offered: (1) keep it, (2) go back to the same dealer, or (3) trade it in to be resold to another family. Mazda’s idea of “safety-first.”</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        For 7 months, Century Mazda and Mazda Canada passed the buck while our family drove an unsafe vehicle. They ignored safety. They ignored the facts. They ignored us.
