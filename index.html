    <h2>7-Month Chronology of Neglect and Failure</h2>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>December 2024</strong>
      Reported persistent acceleration lag that created dangerous merging highway conditions, especially in colder weather. Told we had to wait until January for an appointment.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>January 20, 2025</strong>
      Presented Mazda's official TSB for water intrusion in headlights. Dealer dismissed it until I offered to pay. Car was also dropped off for acceleration lag, but no road test was performed despite my request.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>January 22, 2025</strong>
      I reported that the issue was still present via Mazda's preferred service text method. No reply until February 10.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>January 24 – February 10, 2025</strong>
      Noticed new body damage. Mazda claimed another customer caused it. Only after legal pressure did they admit their employee was responsible. Initially refused escalation. I tracked down the owner via email and was finally called back.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>February 18, 2025</strong>
      Vehicle returned with repairs complete. Acceleration issue reportedly resolved by Mazda Canada EV tech. It was not.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>March 4, 2025</strong>
      Still unresolved. Mazda Canada field reps involved. Asked to bring the car back in.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>March 10–13, 2025</strong>
      Request for alternative transport denied. Car had to be dropped off despite safety concern.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>March 18, 2025</strong>
      Paul, Mazda Canada field tech, installed several software updates. Claimed the issue was fixed.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>March 19, 2025</strong>
      Asked about TSB part for headlights. Told it was only ordered March 6. Jenny from Mazda Canada later said it was installed—still no confirmation. Mazda did not answer.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>March 20–22, 2025</strong>
      Picked up car. Problem reappeared. Mazda stopped replying.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>April 2, 2025</strong>
      Sent strong message. No reply. Told only one advisor was working. Promised callback never happened. Total radio silence resumed.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>April 2025</strong>
      Mazda Canada and Century Mazda ceased all contact. Jenny later said dealers can "choose who they want to deal with." Mazda Canada admitted they can't force dealers to help customers.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>May–June 2025</strong>
      All contact ignored. Car parked. No solution.
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>July 16, 2025</strong>
      Called Mazda Canada. Spoke to Jenny. Two key points:
      <ul>
        <li>1) Told Mazda Canada could not force the dealer to respond—even with a known safety issue. This contradicts Mazda’s compliance policy and brand ethics.</li>
        <li>2) We requested a Mazda Canada-led buyback. Told they wouldn’t help. I pushed for escalation.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
      <strong>July 30, 2025</strong>
      Called Mazda again. Claude picked up and said Jason was now assigned. I asked for a callback. Instead, I received a brief email response that day.
